// Variables

// Use var for variables that can change ("mutable") and let for constants that can't change ("non-mutable").

// Integers are "whole" numbers, i.e. numbers without a fractional component.
var meaningOfLife: Int = 42

// Floats are decimal-point numbers, i.e. numbers with a fractional component.
var phi: Float = 1.618

// Doubles are floating point numbers with double precision, i.e. numbers with a fractional component. Doubles are preferred over floats.
let pi: Double = 3.14159265359

// A String is a sequence of characters, like text.
var message: String = "Hello World!"

// A boolean can be either true or false. You use booleans for logical operations.
var isLoggedIn: Bool = false

// You can assign the result of an expression to a variable, like this:
var result: Int = 1 + 2

// An expression is programmer lingo for putting stuff like variables, operators, constants, functions, etc. together. Like a + b in this example:
let a = 3
let b = 4
let c = a + b

// Swift can determine the type (Int, Double, String, etc.) of a variable on its own. This is called type inference. In this example, the type of name is inferred to be String.
var name = "Anderson Tagata"

// Variables can be optional, which means it either contains a value or it's nil. Optionals make coding Swift safer and more productive. Here's an optional string:
var optionalMessage: String?
